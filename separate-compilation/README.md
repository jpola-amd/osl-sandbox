Collecting workspace information

This appears to be a HIP (Heterogeneous-Computing Interface for Portability) project focused on separate compilation of GPU code. Here's a summary of the workspace:

## Project Structure
- Main source files:
  - 

main.cpp

 - Contains HIP runtime initialization and test functions
  - 

kernel.cpp

 - Contains a GPU kernel definition
  - 

ops.cpp

 - Contains supporting operations
  - 

CMakeLists.txt

 - CMake build configuration

## Build System
- Uses CMake with Ninja generator
- Configured for AMD GPU platform (ROCm)
- Target architecture is `gfx1030`
- Debug build configuration

## Key Features
- Demonstrates separate compilation of HIP/GPU code
- Contains test cases for:
  - Linking bitcode files
  - Loading HIP modules at runtime
  - Compiling kernels with different methods

## Development Environment
- Using Visual Studio Code
- Has debug configuration via GDB
- ROCm HIP toolkit version 6.3.41981
- Configured for AMD GPU platform

The project exploring different ways to compile and link GPU code separately rather than using single-source compilation

## Manual kernel compilation

`manual_kernel_compilation.sh` presents the workflow from BC generation trough optimization and linking to final HSA code object that can be loaded  by the HIP runtime.
